      "summary": "The most malevolent and feared spirit in Orcadian folklore. A horrific skinless centaur-like demon from the sea, with visible muscles and veins, single eye, and enormous mouth. Its breath wilts crops and kills livestock, it spreads disease and pestilence, and it is only vulnerable to fresh water.",
      "full": "The Nuckelavee is the most feared and malevolent creature in Orkney Islands folklore, described as a horrific nightmare from the sea. It appears as a skinless centaur-like monstrosity with a human torso fused to a horse body, but with no skin whatsoever - its muscles, sinews, veins, and arteries are completely visible. Black blood flows through yellow veins, and its single enormous eye burns red. Its massive mouth extends nearly across the entire head. The creature's breath is so poisonous it wilts crops, kills livestock, and causes disease in humans. The Nuckelavee emerges from the sea in summer to spread plague, destroy crops, cause droughts, and kill indiscriminately. It is pure malevolence incarnate. However, it has one critical weakness: fresh water. The Nuckelavee cannot cross fresh water streams and burns or dissolves upon contact with it, even avoiding rainfall. In Orcadian tradition, the Nuckelavee is imprisoned in the sea during winter by the Mither o' the Sea (Sea Mother), only emerging in summer when her powers wane. It represents pestilence, famine, and all evils that afflict island communities."
